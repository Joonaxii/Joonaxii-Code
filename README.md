A collection(WILL BE ONE :D) of different systems, extensions, etc made by me.

Uses .Net Framework 4.7


Right now this only contains some Text Compression and IO stuff I've made recently. Mainly some attempts at LZW compression and my own sort of "hybrid compression algorithm" that I've dubbed TTC (Text Token Compression) which basically is just a word compression with extra stuff. It also utilizes the previously mentioned LZW compression where applicable.

# Text Compression/IO

## NOTES
<b>The test strings used int the example screenshots below actually result in a larger size than what the original string would be. The string used are there just to simplify the explanation for how each compression method works.</b>

<b>I found that compressing JSON, HTML and other similar text files works best with the TTC compression. 

So text with a lot of repeating words and other patterns work the best.  Some text that doesn't have much repetition or is just a lot of random chars might produce a larger file than the original is.</b>

## LZW Usage
LZW has 2 ways to use it. The recommended way is the version that uses the C# Binary Writer/Reader, because then it can work to it's fullest by writing the header etc. You can also use the one that returns a List of integers, though that won't be able to add the necessary header which would allow better compression.

An example of how to use the LZW Compression/Decompression:

An example of how to use the Binary Writer/Reader version of LZW:

## TTC Usage
TTC is more elaborate than LZW, but *unfortunately* still very situational. It utilizes LZW where applicable as well as an extended way of compressing the data even further.
TTC only supports the Binary Writer/Reader version since it relies on header data that must be present. 

Like previously mentioned, TTC also utilizes LZW in some cases. 
These cases include: 
   * **If the average word length in the text is more than a MAX_AVERAGE of 10 chars, TTC fallsback to LZW.**
   * **If the data generated by TTC is passed to LZW and it comes out as smaller, TTC returns the compressed TTC --> LZW data.**
   * **Or if the input string's size is less than 4KB and the LZW would be able to get a smaller file size than TTC, TTC fallsback to LZW.**
